# CAB230 Web Computing - Client Side Assignment

This assessment entailed creating a react application with the objective of providing users with the ability to query and view stock market data supplied by a REST API. This project was an introduction to using react and node packages. 

The REST API is no longer available so this project can not be locally deployed. However a demonstration is available [here](https://youtu.be/P93-DWxg6qY)
